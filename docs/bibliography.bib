abstract = {SUMMARY Multivariate data analysis permits the study of observations which are finite sets of numbers, but modern data collection situations can involve data, or the processes giving rise to them, which are functions. Functional data analysis involves infinite dimensional processes and/or data. The paper shows how the theory of L-splines can support generalizations of linear modelling and principal components analysis to samples drawn from random functions. Spline smoothing rests on a partition of a function space into two orthogonal subspaces, one of which contains the obvious or structural components of variation among a set of observed functions, and the other of which contains residual components. This partitioning is achieved through the use of a linear differential operator, and we show how the theory of polynomial splines can be applied more generally with an arbitrary operator and associated boundary constraints. These data analysis tools are illustrated by a study of variation in temperature–precipitation patterns among some Canadian weather-stations.},

It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems.}},

abstract = {Abstract Functional regression is used to model longitudinal data where the number of measurements on the functional covariate is much greater than the number of subjects in the study. Thus, functional regression can be thought of as singular longitudinal analysis. We have modified existing functional regression techniques to the case of a functional covariate with a repeated stimulus. We applied this modified functional regression to periodically stimulated foetal heart rates. The heart rate tracings were used as a predictor of the child's psychomotor development at approximately 18 months of age. In the past, this type of data has been analysed using the partially subjective concept of habituation. By using the entire heart rate tracings through functional regression, we have the advantage that habituation does not need to be defined and all available information is used to predict later child development.

We present our approach for discrimination of pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground short circuits in VSC DC cables. We provide a detailed case study with Monte Carlo analysis.
